## Quick Starts

### About Quick Starts

Development for BNS JAVA Client SDK require the following prerequisite:

- An BNS JAVA Client SDK
- A machine running with Linux / MacOS / Windows 10

Depending on your operating system, our SDK supports several development environments:

- Visual Studio Code (VSCode) : You need to install [Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) for VSCode. This extension enables you to develop and execute our SDK in Linux, MacOS and Windows enviroments.

- Command Line Interface (CLI)

- IntelliJ IDEA

The quickstarts are intended to guide you through the steps to install the software that SDK will need, configure the settings for Sample Code, and check the result after doing ledgerinput. Quick starts involved following steps:

<!-- no toc -->
1. [Download the BNS JAVA Client SDK](#1-download-the-sdk)
2. [Install packages required to BNS JAVA Client SDK](#2-install-packages-required-to-sdk)
3. [Configure setting for Sample Code](#3-configure-the-settings-for-sample-code)
4. [Run the Sample code](#4-run-the-sample-code)
5. [Check the result](#5-check-the-result)

Complete the quickstarts for each step, then you will be ready to run the tutorial and develop our SDK with your own applications.

### 1. Download the SDK

To download the code, you will need to install [git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git) (If not installed yet) and then type

```shell
> git clone https://github.com/itrustmachines/bns-java-client.git
```

### 2. Install packages required to SDK

Before you run the SDK, you need to add required packages to your computer if they are not already installed. Depending on your operating systems, enter the following commands in terminal. You may omit packages that are already installed but make sure your java version is higher than 8, you can type `java --version` in terminal to check.

- Please refer to [Java official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) to install or upgrade the Java

- Please refer to [Maven official website](https://maven.apache.org) to install or upgrade the Maven

### 3. Configure the settings for Sample Code

This configuration file is very important. Main program use this configuration file to initialize the BNS Java Client. Configuration file includes private key, blockchain address, Email setting ... etc.

Modifying the configuration file require the following prerequisites:

1. Private key : To make sure the reliability of every data source, we need a unique private key to process digital signature for each data source. Please export you private key from MetaMask and private key in safe place. Anyone with your private key can access your MetaMask wallet.

2. Rinkeby Blockchain Node URL : In order to get the On-Chain proof, we need to access the node of blockchain. We use Rinkeby blockchain for our testing environment. The Rinkeby blockchain node URL can obtain via Infura. Please check the [Infura tutorial](./infura_en.md) to get the Rinkey Node URL.

After obtaining the private key and Rinkeby Node URL, then you will be ready to modify the configuration file [sample.properties](../src/main/resources/sample.properties). Please check the file and follow the instructions in file or below.

```Java
/**
 * Please fill in the 128 bits (32 bytes) Hex encoded
 * private key which you exported from MetaMask.
 */ 
privateKey=

/** Please fill in the URL of BNS Server */
bnsServerUrl=https://azure-dev-membership.itm.monster:8088/
    
/** 
 * Please fill in the Rinkey Node URL which generated by Infura
 */
nodeUrl=https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/{InfuraProjectId}

/**
 * Please fill in your Email which you sign up for BNS Service.
 */        
email=
        
/** BNS Java Client will verify the receipt in the unit of page, you can change the number to set how many receipt will page to take and verify. We will discuss this setting in Tutorial document, you can keep this in default*/
verifyBatchSize=10

/** You can change the number to set how many second delay for each verification. We will discuss this setting in Tutorial document, you can keep this in default*/
verifyDelaySec=1

/** When failed ledgerinput occured, SPO Client will request again. You can change the number to set how many second delay for each retry. We will discuss this setting in Tutorial document, you can keep this in default*/
retryDelaySec=5
```

### 4. Run the Sample Code

#### Command Line Interface
Move to itm-bns-sample folder

```shell
> cd bns-java-client/itm-bns-sample
```

Execute the program to start doing ledgerInput

```shell
> mvn clean package
> java -jar ./target/itm-bns-sample-1.1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

#### Visual Studio Code

1. Open Command Palette
2. Type Maven and choose `Maven : Execute Commands`
3. Choose itm-bns-sample project
4. Choose Custom and type `mvn clean package` to compile the code
5. Execute the `./target/itm-bns-sample-1.1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

#### Intellij IDEA

1. Open itm-spo-sdk-java with Maven Project
2. Click Maven Tool at right panel
3. Click execute maven goal
4. Type `mvn clean package` and press Enter to compile the code
5. right click `itm-bns-sample-1.1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` and click run `itm-bns-sample-1.1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

### 5. Check the result

After executing the sample code. The BNS Java Client will start ledgerinput. You can check the result of ledgerinput on BNS Website.

1. Use your Web Browser to open [BNS Website](https://azure-dev-membership.itm.monster:8088/)

2. Click the Check Records then you can check all of your ledgerinput records

3. Click '+' in one of your legerinput records then you can view the information about ledgerinput.

4. If your data is On-Chain, the Attest status icon will become green and show Success. Otherwise, it will be gray and show Waiting. The default setting of BNS Server is clearance once a day.

5. If your data is On-Chain, you can click On-chain Proof icon to view the proof on blockchain via blockchain browser.

6. If your data is Off-Chain, you can click Off-chain Proof icon to download the proof and use our Verification Website or Verification Program SDK to verify this data whether be tampered.

7. Click the verification icon

8. Click Blockchain verification

9. Upload the Off-chain proof your downloaded

10. If Off-Chain proof is tempered-free, the Verify Result icon will become green, otherwise, it will be red.
